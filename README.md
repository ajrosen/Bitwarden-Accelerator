## Options

### Bitwarden user

Your Bitwarden email address.

### Auto Sync

Installs a macOS *Launch Agent* that automatically syncs your vault every *Sync Interval* minutes.

### Login method

Choose whether to be prompted for your *Password* or use an *API Key* to login.  *SSO* is not yet supported.

### Client ID and Client Secret

These are the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* used for *API Key* logins.  They are ignored when using the *Password* login method.  See [Personal API Key for CLI Authentication](https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/) for more information.

### Two-step login method

Choose *Authenticator app*, *YubiKey OTP*, or *Email*.  *FIDO2* and *Duo* are not supported by the CLI.  This is ignored when using the *API Key* login method.  See [Two-step Login Methods](https://bitwarden.com/help/setup-two-step-login/) for more information.

### Touch ID

You can unlock your vault with Touch ID instead of entering your master password.  It does this by using *sudo* to store and retrieve your password in a secure location.  See [Using Touch ID](https://github.com/ajrosen/Bitwarden-Accelerator/blob/main/Touch%20ID.md) for details.

You will see a window that says `sudo is trying to execute a command as administrator`.  If you select Cancel you will be prompted for your system password instead.

<img width="372" alt="sudo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec32c44f-8bcd-4299-ab62-c2b3f3aa18df" />

If you select Cancel from the password entry window, you will be prompted for your Bitwarden master password.

### Favorites icon service

Choose a service to download favorites icons.  The default is ***None***; Bitwarden Accelerator will continue to show the default icon for all login items.

If you choose a service, icons will be downloaded in the background.  You can continue to use Bitwarden Accelerator while the icon cache is being populated.

N.B. The icon cache is removed when Bitwarden Accelerator's version changes.  Icons will be redownloaded the next time you list items in your vault.

### Vault timeout

How long Bitwarden can be inactive before timing out. *Inactivity* is determined by the time since invoking the workflow.

### Custom timeout

Sets the timeout value when *Vault timeout* is *Custom*.

### When screen is locked

Lock your vault when the screen is locked.  The default is **true**.

### Vault timeout action

What Bitwarden will do once the vault timeout is reached.  Choices are **Lock vault** and **Logout**.

### Bitwarden server

The Bitwarden server hosting your vault.  The default is *bitwarden.com*, the US server.

### Downloads Folder

Where to save attachments downloaded from your vault.  The default is your Downloads folder.  If you leave this blank, Bitwarden Accelerator will ask you to choose a folder each time.

### Clipboard time

How many seconds Bitwarden Accelerator will keep your password (or other field) in the clipboard.  Afterwards, the previous contents of the clipboard are restored.

### Sync Interval

Bitwarden Accelerator will sync your vault when you load the worfklow if it has not been synced in this many minutes.

### Notifications

Uncheck this to keep Bitwarden Accelerator from displaying a notification when copying your password (or other field) to the clipboard.

## Invoking

There are three ways to invoke Bitwarden Accelerator.

1. Using the Workflow Keyword (default: ***bw***) will provide a list of operations.  The list depends on whether you are logged into or logged out of Bitwarden, and whether your vault is locked or unlocked.
2. Typing the ***hotkey*** will start a search of your vault.  This is the same as choosing the **Search Vault** operation from the main menu.
3. As a Universal Action, you can view an item's fields directly in Alfred.

The default hotkey is ***Control-Command-L***, because the Bitwarden browser extension uses *Shift-Command-L*.  If you wish to change or disable the hotkey, open the workflow in *Alfred Preferences*.  The hotkey trigger is in the top-left corner.

### Trash

Using the Trash Keyword (default: ***.bwtrash***) will list any deleted items.  Select an item to restore it.

## Managing favorites icons

The *Managing favorites icons* menu has three options.

* Delete cache

This completely removes the icons cache.  Icons will be redownloaded the next time you list items in your vault.

* Fetch icons

If there is no icons cache, Bitwarden Accelerator will automatically try to download icons using your chosen service.

You can use this menu option to refresh the icons at any time.  It will (attempt to) download any favorites icons that are missing.  Any vault item that has been modified since its icon was last downloaded will also have its icon redownloaded.  I.e., if a vault item is newer than the icon, fetch its icon.

* Choose icon service

This will open *Alfred Preferences* to the configuration screen.  Bitwarden Accelerator supports five services that you can use to download favorites icons.

1. Bitwarden
1. DuckDuckGo
1. Favicone
1. Google
1. Icon Horse

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/) must already be installed.*
